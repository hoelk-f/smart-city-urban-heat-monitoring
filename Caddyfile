# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# Unless the file starts with a global options block, the first
# uncommented line is always the address of your site.
#
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace ":80" below with your
# domain name.

:80 {
  # Redirect root requests to the Angular application base path
  redir / /smart-city-urban-heat-monitoring/

  # Proxy all requests under the base path to the Angular container
  handle_path /smart-city-urban-heat-monitoring/* {
    reverse_proxy smart-city-urban-heat-monitoring:4200
  }
}
